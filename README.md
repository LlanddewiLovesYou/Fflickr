Fflickr


What it does:
* Like the popular photo-hosting website, only jankier.

Link:
* https://fflickr.herokuapp.com/#/

Technologies used:
* The app is built with a Rails backend which handles primarily requests to the database and renders JSON. The frontend components are built with React-Redux, making use of Amazon Web Services to handle the actual image hosting.

Features:
* At the present moment, the app features photos and albums. Users can upload photos through a drag and drop interface accomplished with the ‘dropzone’ library. Users can store a small amount of metadata with their photos including titles and captions. Albums allow a user to group their photos for display, again with metadata about the album itself.
